# Network-Intrusion
🚀 Building an AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System

I developed a deep learning-based solution to detect malicious network traffic with 98.66% accuracy!

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ LSTM Neural Network trained on 2.8M+ network traffic records
✅ Behavior-based detection using sequential pattern analysis
✅ Manual optimization approach overcoming PyTorch limitations
✅ Comprehensive data pipeline handling class imbalance and feature engineering

This project demonstrates how AI can enhance cybersecurity by identifying threats in real-time network data.
